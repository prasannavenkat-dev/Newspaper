          <h2>WHO says ‘will do everything’ to discover origin of COVID-19</h2>
          <p>
            The World Health Organization (WHO) insisted on Monday it would do
            everything possible to find the animal origins of Covid-19,
            insisting that knowledge was vital to preventing future
            outbreaks.“We want to know the origin and we will do everything to
            know the origin,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told
            reporters.
          </p>
          <p>
            The United States, which with more than 262,000 deaths is the
            country hardest hit by the pandemic, has been harshly critical of
            the WHO's handling of the crisis and has accused it of kowtowing to
            China and of dragging its feet on investigating how the outbreak
            first started.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other critics have also voiced concern that the agency may have
            allowed China to dictate the terms of an international investigation
            into the origins of the virus, which first surfaced in the Chinese
            city of Wuhan late last year.

              <h3>Oppn rallies behind farmers, slams govt</h3>
              <p>
                As part of the campaign, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi asked his
                party workers to ensure that they should help protesting farmers
                and provide them with food in their own areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Congress has lodged a campaign called Speak Up for Farmers,
                that aims to mobilise workers in solidarity with those
                protesting on the streets.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of the campaign, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi asked his
                party workers to ensure that they should help protesting farmers
                and provide them with food in their own areas. “Farmers are the
                strength of the country and yet why are they on the streets
                having walked so far? If these farm laws are in their favour,
                why is the farmer so angry? These laws are for 2-3 friends of
                Narendra Modi. These laws aim to rob farmers,’’ he said in a
                video message.

                New Delhi, Nov 30: The national capital witnessed more polluted
                November this year than in 2019, largely due to lesser
                precipitation and large-scale stubble burning. The city also
                recorded nine "severe" air days this November, the maximum
                number in the month in four years.

                Officials said the clampdown on the mafia in western UP started
                in July in line with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's directives
                which came close on the heels of the killing of eight policemen
                in Kanpur by henchmen of gangster Vikas Dubey, who was
                eventually killed in an encounter by the Special Task Force.

              <p>
                "An ill-gotten land piece measuring 2.98 hectare and estimated
                worth ₹ 25 crore of Nizamuddin has been attached by the Gautam
                Buddh Nagar police under the Gangsters Act," Deputy Commissioner
                of Police, Greater Noida, Rajesh Kumar Singh said.
